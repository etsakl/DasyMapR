\description{
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eurostat set up the NUTS classification as a single, coherent system for dividing up the EUs territory in order to produce regional statistics for the Community. For around thirty years, implementation and updating of the NUTS classification was managed under a series of "gentlemen s agreements" between the Member States and Eurostat.However, sometimes national interests require changing the regional breakdown of a country. When this happens the country concerned informs the European Commission about the changes.
