#' @title NUTSV9_LEAC: Administrative land accounting units in Lambert Equal Area
#'
#'@description GISCO administrative boundaries (NUTS) v9 generalised using the 1 km reference grid for the Land cover accounts project (LEAC) Administrative land accounting units are used to allocate land cover changes and to relate socio-economic processes to land cover dynamics. The GISCO database (Eurostat) provides a medium-scale layer for regional administrative boundaries (NUTS) covering the entire EU territory. The hierarchy of administrative land accounting units allows the analysis of the data at various scales, from NUTS 3 (province level) to NUTS 0 (country level). A mixed level, combining NUTS 3 and NUTS 2 was defined in order to homogenize the size of the units.

#' @title  Administrative or Statistical unit NUTS2013
#'
#' @description At the beginning of the 1970s, Eurostat set up the NUTS classification as a single, coherent system for dividing up the EUs territory in order to produce regional statistics for the Community. For around thirty years, implementation and updating of the NUTS classification was managed under a series of "gentlemen s agreements" between the Member States and Eurostat.However, sometimes national interests require changing the regional breakdown of a country. When this happens the country concerned informs the European Commission about the changes.
