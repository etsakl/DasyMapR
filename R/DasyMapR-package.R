#' DasyMapR
#'
#' The process of dasymetric mapping is the transformation of data
#' from a set of arbitrary source zones to a dasymetric map via the overlay of
#' the source zones with an ancillary data set.This package contains a number of
#' fucntions that assist preparing vector and raster source and ancillary datasets
#' for intelligent dasymetric mapping, performs the dasymetric calculations, and
#' then generates a floating point output raster of revised density.
#' TO BE NOTICED : It uses the ETRS89-LAEA geographic grid to do the job.
